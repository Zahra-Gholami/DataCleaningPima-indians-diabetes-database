# Pima Indian Diabetes Project (CRISP-DM Methodology)

### Skils : 
Data analysis, machine learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation
### Tools : 
IBM SPSS Modeler,
### Description : 
Applied the CRISP-DM methodology to a Pima Indian diabetes
dataset. Completed all phases including business understanding, data
preparation, modeling, and evaluation.
### Outcome : 
Developed models to predict diabetes with high accuracy,
providing insights for potential clinical applications.

 > #### I completed all six phases of the CRISP-DM methodology, including:
>
>- **Business Understanding** : 
> Defined the objectives of the project,
> focusing on predicting diabetes in the Pima Indian population.
>
>- **Data Understanding** : Explored and analyzed the dataset to identify
> patterns, outliers, and missing values.
>
>- **Data Preparation** : Cleaned and preprocessed the data, including
> handling missing values and normalizing features.
>
>- **Modeling** : Applied machine learning models to predict the likelihood of
> diabetes, experimenting with various algorithms.
>
>- **Evaluation** : Assessed the models' performance using metrics such as
> accuracy and precision.
>
>- **Deployment** : Provided insights and recommendations based on the
> model's predictions for further research or practical applications.

#### This project gave me hands-on experience with the CRISP-DM framework enhancing my skills in data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
